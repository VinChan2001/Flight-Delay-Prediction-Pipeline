# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Delay Prediction using XGBoost and Real-Time CLI

This project builds a real-time flight delay prediction system using machine learning, combining extensive flight performance data from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), enriched with weather and holiday metadata. The final model is deployed as a command-line interface (CLI) tool that predicts the likelihood of delay for a given flight using historical patterns.

## üì¶ Dataset Overview

- **Source**: U.S. BTS On-Time Performance (July‚ÄìDecember 2024)  
- **Records Processed**: ~3.6 million  
- **External Sources**:  
  - [OpenFlights](https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights) ‚Äì airport geolocation  
  - Visual Crossing Weather API ‚Äì origin/destination weather  
  - U.S. Federal Holiday data  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing Highlights

- Combined monthly BTS files into a single DataFrame  
- Cleaned fields like `FL_DATE`, `CARRIER`, `ORIGIN`, `DEST`, etc.  
- Parsed times, removed nulls/duplicates  
- Added airport geolocation for weather API querying

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Delay Definition**: Arrival delay > 15 minutes  
- **Overall Delay Rate**: 19.65%  
- **Monthly Delay Rates**:
  - July: 29.52%  
  - October: 13.61%  
  - December: 21.65%  
- **Airlines**:
  - WN (Southwest) had most flights: 706,659  
  - NK (Spirit) had the highest delay rate  
- **Insights**:
  - Delays more frequent during holidays and peak hours  
  - Peak travel and bad weather significantly raise delay risk  

---

## üõ† Feature Engineering

- **Time-based**: Hour of day, day of week, red-eye/rush hour  
- **Cyclical encoding**: Sine/cosine for hour, month  
- **Weather**: Categorical label (rain, fog, etc.) + severity score (0‚Äì10)  
- **Holiday flags**: Specific federal holidays + peak travel periods  
- **Airline & airport codes**: One-hot encoded  

---

## ü§ñ Modeling

- **Goal**: Classify flights as Delayed (1) or On-Time (0)  
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Classifier  
- **Tuning**: GridSearchCV  
- **Validation**: Stratified 3-fold cross-validation  

### ‚úÖ Final Model Performance

| Metric               | Score    |
|----------------------|----------|
| Cross-Val Accuracy   | 70.40%   |
| Final Test Accuracy  | 70.44%   |
| Final Test ROC AUC   | 0.7622   |
| Decision Threshold   | 49.0%    |

## üíª Deployment: CLI Tool

Users can input flight details through a command-line interface. The tool loads the trained model and outputs:

- **Prediction**: Delayed / On Time  
- **Probability of Delay**  
- **Confidence Level**  
- **Delay Risk Factors** (weather, holiday, timing)  

### ‚úàÔ∏è Sample CLI Input

```bash
python predictor.py
```
Prompts for:
	‚Ä¢	Date, airline code, flight number
	‚Ä¢	Origin & destination airports
	‚Ä¢	Actual & scheduled departure/arrival times
	‚Ä¢	Flight distance
	‚Ä¢	Weather conditions & severity
	‚Ä¢	Holiday indicator
